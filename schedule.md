*The Blue Dawn Hackathon will take place over the course of a Friday - Sunday, but in the week leading up there will be many workshops to get you up to speed!*

## Event Weekend Schedule
*TBD*

## Workshop Schedule
*These workshops are held by both fellow student CubeSat engineers and memebers of industry! For all workshops (unless otherwise noted) it is assumed that attendees are going in with little to no knowledge of the subject at hand*
